# Magda

A platform for emmersing one self in the power of beauty, chance, and juxtaposition.

# What?

There are so many beautiful things in this world. Art, a quote, a picture from your loved ones. As we pass through life we are enriched when we encounter these things. But, so often they are hidden from our eye, or they are arranged so staticially that we miss out on all the new thigns being produced everyday.

Wouldn't it be great if you could emerser you self in those touch points. For them to slowly evolve around you everyday. From your house, to your phone, to the screens around you.

Magda is my attempt to build a platform for that experience.

# How?

Great question. I don't know exactly.
